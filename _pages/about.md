Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently an (tenure-track) associate professor in the Institute of Marine Science and Technology, Shandong University, China. Before joining Shandong University, I was a Research Fellow in the Singtel-NTU Corp Lab (SCALE@NTU) in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I received my PhD degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), in 2018. I received my bachelor's and master's degree from Shandong University, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

Research Interests
======
My research mainly lies in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research. I am particularly interested in leveraging Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning to solve challenging combinatorial optimization problems in various application domains, such as scheduling, vehicle routing, and power systems.
